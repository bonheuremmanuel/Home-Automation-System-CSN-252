# Home-Automation-System-CSN-252
This project is based on Arduino UNO micro-controller. In this project we are creating a simple home automated system. We are switching on and off bulbs using a mobile device.This project has real life applications. It can help us to control the electrical appliances through remote devices. The arduino UNO is connected with the Bluetooth(HC-05) and therelay board. The relay board acts as a switch which will control the switching of the desiredappliances i.e., bulbs in this project. For using this setup, we need to pair the bluetooth ofour mobile with the HC-05 module. After pairing, we need to connect the HC-05 modulewith our mobile device. We used an app named ’Arduino Bluetooth Controller’, in whichwe mapped the buttons with the commands that will switch the bulbs on and off. Thecommands are transmitted to the bluetooth which are then sent to the arduino UNO. The microcontroller then runs the received data and then passes the signal to the relay board.Accordingly, the relay board will switch the bulbs on and off.
